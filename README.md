## Introduction
CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) is a parallel computing platform and application programming interface (API) model created by NVIDIA. 
It allows software developers and software engineers to use a CUDA-enabled graphics processing unit (GPU) for general purpose processing â€“ an approach known as GPGPU (General-Purpose computing on Graphics Processing Units).
CUDA is extensively used in fields requiring intensive mathematical computations like deep learning, scientific computing, and engineering simulations. 
By using CUDA, applications can utilize the massively parallel processing power of NVIDIA GPUs to achieve greater performance compared to CPU-only computing.
